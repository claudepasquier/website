abstract = "Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are used in many domains ranging from computer science to bioinformatics, including industry and geoscience. They enable to model complex evolutions where spatial objects (e.g., soil erosion)maymove, (dis)appear,merge or split.We study a new graph-based representation, called attributedDAG(a-DAG). It enables to capture interactions between objects aswell as information on objects (e.g., characteristics or events). In this paper, we focus on pattern mining in such data. Our patterns, called weighted paths, offer a good trade-off between expressiveness and complexity. Frequency and compactness constraints are used to filter out uninteresting patterns. These constraints lead to an exact condensed representation (without loss of information) in the single-graph setting. A depth-first search strategy and an optimized data structure are proposed to achieve the efficiency of weighted path discovery. It does a progressive extension of patterns based on database projections. Relevance, scalability and genericity are illustrated by means of qualitative and quantitative results when mining various real and synthetic datasets. In particular, we show how such an approach can be used to monitor soil erosion using remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) data."
