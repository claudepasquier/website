abstract = "Protein and DNA sequence comparison is one of the most important tool of molecular biologists, but sequence databases are growing at an exponential rate, and sequence comparison is becoming increasingly computationally intensive. We propose to develop a GRID-enabled parallel blast, GeB, which is implemented on the ProActive platform. With some very good group communication facilities provided by ProActive, we achieved good speedup and scaling results (up to 39 processors). Encouraged by this, we next move to work on a better load-balancing facility which might give a very good speedup for our GeB."
