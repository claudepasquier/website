abstract = "OrienTM is a computer software that utilizes an initial definition of transmembrane segments to predict the topology of transmembrane proteins from their sequence. It uses position-specific statistical information for amino acid residues which belong to putative non-transmembrane segments derived from statistical analysis of non-transmembrane regions of membrane proteins stored in the SwissProt database. Its accuracy compares well with that of other popular existing methods. A web-based version of OrienTM is publicly available at the address http://athina.biol.uoa.gr/OrienTM."
