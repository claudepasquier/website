abstract = "CoPreTHi is a Java based web application, which combines the results of methods that predict the location of transmembrane segments in protein sequences into a joint prediction histogram. Clearly, the joint prediction algorithm, produces superior quality results than individual prediction schemes. The program is available at http://athina.biol.uoa.gr/CoPreTHi."
