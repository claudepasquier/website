abstract = "Directed acyclic graphs can be used across many application domains. In this paper, we study a new pattern domain for supporting their analy- sis. Therefore, we propose the pattern language of weighted paths, primitive constraints that enable to specify their relevancy (e.g., frequency and com- pactness constraints), and algorithms that can com- pute the specified collections. It leads to a con- densed representation setting whose efficiency and scalability are empirically studied."
