abstract = "Microarray technology produces vast amounts of data by measuring simultaneously the expression levels of thousands of genes under hundreds of biological conditions. Nowa- days, one of the principal challenges in bioinformatics is the interpretation of this large amount of data using different sources of information. We have developed a novel data analysis method named CGGA (Co-expressed Gene Groups Analysis) that automatically finds groups of genes that are functionally enriched, i.e. have the same functional annota- tions, and are co-expressed. CGGA automatically integrates the information of microar- rays, i.e. gene expression profiles, with the functional annotations of the genes obtained by the genome-wide information sources such as Gene Ontology. By applying CGGA to well- known microarray experiments, we have identified the principal functionally enriched and co-expressed gene groups, and we have shown that this approach enhances and accelerates the interpretation of DNA microarray experiments."
