abstract = "Weaning from mechanical ventilation (MV) is a key phase in the management of intensive care unit (ICU) patient. According to the WEAN SAFE study, weaning from MV initiation is defined as the first attempt to separate a patient from the ventilator and the success is the absence of reintubation (or death) within 7xa0days of extubation. Mortality rates increase with the difficulty of weaning, reaching 38% for the most challenging cases. Predicting the success of weaning is difficult, due to the complexity of factors involved. The many biosignals that are measured in patients during ventilation may be considered “weak signals”, a concept rarely used in medicine. The aim of this research is to investigate the performance of machine learning (ML) models based on biosignals to predict spontaneous breathing trial success (SBT) using biosignals and to identify the most important variables."
