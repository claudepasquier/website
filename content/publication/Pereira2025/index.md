abstract = "We propose a novel refinement of a gradual polarity propagation method to learn the polarities of concepts and their uncertainties with respect to various domains from a labeled corpus. Our contribution consists of introducing a positive correction term in the polarity propagation equation to counterbalance negative psychological bias in reviews. The proposed approach is evaluated using a standard benchmark, showing an improved performance relative to the state of the art, good cross-domain transfer and excellent coverage."
