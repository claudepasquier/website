Claude Pasquier is researcher at [French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS)](http://www.cnrs.fr/index.php/en).

He received a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Nice - Sophia Antipolis (now [Université Côte d'Azur](http://univ-cotedazur.fr/en)), France, in 1994.
During his thesis, he explored the use of software engineering paradigms in the field of structured document manipulation.
He defined both a frame-based language for representing document models, and a system of context-aware document generation and configuration (cf. [Prototype-based programming](project/prototype_based_programming).

Subsequently, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Biophysics and Bioinformatics Laboratory of the University of Athens](http://biophysics.biol.uoa.gr/), Greece, where he conducted research on [protein structure prediction](project/protein_structure_prediction).

He held positions at the [National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (INRIA)](https://www.inria.fr/en) and with Schlumberger, Smart Cards & Terminals division (now [Gemalto](https://www.gemalto.com/)) where he worked on [generative programming](project/generative_programming).

Since 2002 when he joined CNRS, he successively worked at [Villefranche Oceanographic Laboratory (LOV)](http://www.obs-vlfr.fr/), the [Institute of Biology Valrose (iBV)](http://ibv.unice.fr/) and [New Caledonia Institute of Exact and Applied Sciences (ISEA)](https://isea.unc.nc/) where he addressed topics as diverse as semantic data integration, [omics data mining](project/omics_data_mining) and [attributed graph mining](project/attributed_graph_mining).

Currently at [I3S laboratory](http://i3s.unice.fr/en), he is conducting research focused on [complex network mining](project/complex_network_mining) that combines computer science and systems biology.
