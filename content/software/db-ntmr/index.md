DB-NTMR contains the inter-transmembrane regions of 9392 transmembrane
proteins automatically extracted from the SwissProt database. Each
non-transmembrane segment is described in one record containing:

-   the access code of the sequence containing the segment (ID line),
-   the index number of the region in the same sequence,
-   the length of the transmembrane region,
-   the start and end position of the region,
-   the location of the region in the protein described by the letter
    'E' for Extracellular, the letter 'C' for Cytoplasmic, or a question
    mark if unknown,
-   the amino-acid letters of the residues located inside the considered
    region.
