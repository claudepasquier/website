AllOnto [@Pasquier2008a;@Pasquier2011] is a Knowledge Base System capable of storing and performing
queries on a large set of RDF/OWL specifications (including the storing
and querying of reified statements). It includes reasoning capabilities
like type inference, transitivity and the handling of these two OWL
constructs: "sameAs" and "inverseOf". In addition, it is capable of
storing and querying the provenance of information.
