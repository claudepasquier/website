The BIBLE system [@Pasquier1992;@Pasquier1994] allowed an intelligent organization of the logical and physical representations of structured documents. The system implemented a form of dynamic sharing based on delegation and cloning of prototypes. The underlying mechanism was inspired by Prototype Oriented Programming, which was a promising new line of research in the early 1990s.
