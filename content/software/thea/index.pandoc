THEA (Tools for High-throughput Experiments Analysis) [@Pasquier2004a] is an integrated
information processing system allowing convenient handling of data. It
allows to automatically annotate data issued from classification systems
with selected biological information coming from a knowledge base and to
either manually search and browse through these annotations or
automatically generate meaningful generalizations according to
statistical criteria (data mining).
