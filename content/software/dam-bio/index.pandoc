Computational analysis of protein sequences with statistical models,
machine learning techniques or empirical rules leads to prediction of
structural and functional features of the corresponding molecules.
Taking into account the recent explosion of biological information in
terms of complete genome sequences the use of computational tools of
analysis is considered essential. Individual tools are available through
the Internet, and their performance depends on their liability and
simplicity of use. Dam-Bio [@Liakopoulos2000;@Liakopoulos2001b] is a workspace that establishes data
trafficking towards a collection of tools, communication between them
and simple representation of the results of sequence and structure
analysis. At the sequence level, the following are offered: analysis of
periodical features, structural classification with neural networks,
prediction of secondary structure, prediction and topology of
transmembrane regions and multiple sequence alignment. At the structure
level, the creation and representation of protein structures and
three-dimensional fit is possible. The end-user is offered with a
user-friendly interface and a simple representation of the results. The
system's open and decentralized design permits the addition of new
individual modules that may reside anywhere on the Internet. Our future
plans include the development of modules for fold recognition, receptor
prediction and sequence complexity analysis. Interconnection between the
system, the individual tools and the user is established through the
HTTP protocol, the only requirement for its usage being Internet access.
