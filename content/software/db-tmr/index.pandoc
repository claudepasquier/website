DB-TMR contains 40672 transmembrane regions of 9392 transmembrane
proteins automatically extracted from the SwissProt database. Each
transmembrane segment is described in one record containing:

-   the access code of the sequence containing the segment (ID line),
-   the organism classification (OC lines),
-   the length of the transmembrane region,
-   the direction of the transmembrane when it can be deducted thanks to
    the keywords 'CYTOPLASMIC' and 'EXTRACELLULAR' of the feature table,
-   the amino-acid letters of the five-residue extension outside the
    transmembrane for the N and C-terminal side,
-   the amino-acid letters of the residues located inside the
    transmembrane.
