PRED-TMR [@Pasquier1999a] is a method that predicts transmembrane domains in proteins
using solely information contained in the sequence itself. The algorithm
refines a standard hydrophobicity analysis with a detection of potential
termini ("edges", starts and ends) of transmembrane regions. This
allows one both to discard highly hydrophobic regions not delimited by
clear start and end configurations and to confirm putative transmembrane
segments not distinguishable by their hydrophobic composition. The
accuracy obtained on a test set of 101 non-homologous transmembrane
proteins with reliable topologies compares well with that of other
popular existing methods. Only a slight decrease in prediction accuracy
was observed when the algorithm was applied to all transmembrane
proteins of the SwissProt database (release 35).
