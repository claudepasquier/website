### Supplementary data ###

[**Supplemental Dataset S1**](../../data/rna_biology_2020/Supplemental_dataset_S1.xlsx): List of potentially targeted mRNAs that we identified by calculation.

[**Supplemental Dataset S2**](../../data/rna_biology_2020/Supplemental_dataset_S2.xlsx): List of potential dsRNA heteroduplexes identified between lncRNAs and mRNAs.

[**Supplemental Dataset S3**](../../data/rna_biology_2020/Supplemental_dataset_S3.xlsx): List of potential dsRNA heteroduplexes identified between mRNAs and mRNAs.

[**Supplemental Dataset S4**](../../data/rna_biology_2020/Supplemental_dataset_S4.xlsx): List of potential dsRNA heteroduplexes identified between introns and mRNAs.

[**Supplemental Dataset S5**](../../data/rna_biology_2020/Supplemental_dataset_S5.xlsx): List of genes belonging to the interaction network obtained with a minimal exact match of 20 bases with their Gene Ontology enrichments.

[**Supplemental Dataset S6**](../../data/rna_biology_2020/Supplemental_dataset_S6.xlsx): List of genes belonging to the interaction networks obtained with minimal exact matches of 20 and 30 bases with their Gene Ontology enrichments.

[**Supplemental Dataset S7**](../../data/rna_biology_2020/Supplemental_dataset_S7.xlsx): p-values of the statistical presence of the genes within the network of dsRNA interaction in the expressed/no expressed genes during 12 development stages.

[**Supplemental Dataset S8**](../../data/rna_biology_2020/Supplemental_dataset_S8.xlsx): List of genes belonging to the interaction networks constructed with co-expressed genes at several development stages. The dataset also includes corresponding Gene Ontology enrichments.
